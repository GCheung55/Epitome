<p>Epitome is a poor man's Model/View/* for MooTools, created by Dimitar Christoff and used in part at QMetric Group.
Licence: MIT</p>

<p>Groc <code>Documentation</code> is available here: <a href="http://dimitarchristoff.github.com/Epitome/">http://dimitarchristoff.github.com/Epitome/</a>
A default <code>.groc.json</code> file is added so you can just run <code>groc</code> in the root to freshen.</p>

<p>The creation and logic employed in the writing of Epitome has been documented in these blog posts:</p>

<p>As this is very much work in progress, I cannot guarantee that it is a MVC library in the true sense of the 'word'. This is
because as of yet, I am unable to decide the degree of responsibility the individual components outside of the Model will
actually have. It could well develop into a MVP and not MVC.</p>

<p>The core module is called Epitome and it has the following structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Epitome.isEqual</code> - a module for comparing values, borrowed from _.js</li>
<li><code>Epitome.Model</code> - the model itself</li>
<li><code>Epitome.Model.Sync</code> - a plugin for keeping your model in sync with a REST endpoint.</li>
<li><code>Epitome.Collection</code> - a pseudo controller, Observing all model events (not done)</li>
<li><code>Epitome.View</code> - view rendered, using whatever 3-rd party templating engine (not done)</li>
<li><code>Epitome.Plugins</code> - A free-type Object of methods/extensions that can be implemented into Models, like validation (not done)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests via Buster.js can be found in <code>/tests/</code> - check the README.md there for more info.</p>

<p>This is not a working repository in the sense that it's not being released as a product you can use. It's more of an educational
experience documenting the process involved in creating a MV* (MVP/MVVM) library on top of MooTools. There are over 100
MV* libraries out there and the last thing anyone needs is another abandon-ware product.</p>

<p>Having said that, the components work fine and it will eventually be fully operational. Feel free to fork, play and contribute
back to the project if you can, pull requests are more than welcome.</p>
