<p><a href="http://busterjs.org">buster-test.js</a> is a new up-and-coming javascript testing framework in development.</p>

<p>It features standalone static testing or CI testing via node with browser capture.
To see the basic example static test runner, load  <code>index.html</code></p>

<p>To install buster:</p>

<pre><code># npm install -g buster
</code></pre>

<p>To start the static tester:</p>

<pre><code># buster static
</code></pre>

<p>To start in capture mode for multiple browsers:</p>

<pre><code># buster server &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have captured your target browsers, just run:</p>

<pre><code># buster test
</code></pre>

<p>Or even better:</p>

<pre><code># buster autotest
</code></pre>

<p>Standalone testing via <code>buster test</code> w/o browser capture is not supported yet, though you could probably try jsdom or phantom.js - edit buster-test.js config and give it a go. Also, you'd need the server only version of mootools.</p>

<p>Auto-testing is experimental but fairly good for MacOSX at present. You can see it in action on our blog here: http://tech.qmetric.co.uk/running-automated-javascript-testing-with-buster-js-autotest_123.html</p>

<p><strong>nb</strong> please note that when in capture mode via <code>buster server</code>, IE7 and IE8 will fire an exception - which is to do with lack of <code>Object.create</code>, referenced in one of buster's dependencies <code>bundle.js</code>. As a work-around, an es5-shim has been provided that makes tests run in IE7/8 as well.</p>
